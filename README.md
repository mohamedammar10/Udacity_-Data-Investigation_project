Data investigation for IMDB dataset submitted through Professional track nanodegree program

Project Breif

Introduction

I shoose to conduct a data analysis for IMDB dataset. It was requested to look at the dataset and brainstorming questions you could answer using it. Then should use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. It was not requested to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project which could be done later for future work for the the same project. This project was open-ended in that not looking for one right answer.
